Supervised vs Unsupervised

Supervised:
 1. Requires training data with independent variables & a dependent variables (labelled data)
 2. Need labelled data to "supervise" the algorithm when learning from the data
 examples
  -Regression Models
  -Classification Models

Unsupervised:
 1. Requires training data with independent variables only
 2. Not Need labelled data that can "supervise" the algorithm when learning from data
 examples
  -Clustering Models
  -Outlier Detection Models

Regression vs Classification

Regression:
 1. Can be used when the response variable to be predicted is a continuous variable (scaler)
 examples:
  -Linear Regression, Fixed Effects Regression, XGBoost Regression

Classification:
 1. Can be used when the response variable to be predicted is a continuous variable (scaler)
 examples:
  -Logistic Regression, XGBoost Classification

Training Machine Learning Model (Simplest version):

Step 1
    Data Preparation
      Split the data into train, validation and test.
Step 2
    Model Trainig
      Train the model on the training data and save the fitted model.
Step 3
    Hyper-Parameter Tuning
      Use the fitted Model and Validation Set to find the optimal set of parameters where the model performs the best.
Step 4
    Prediction
      Use the optimal set of parameters from Hyper-Parameter Tunning data, to train the model again with these hyeper parameters, use this best fitted model to predictions on test data.
Step 5
    Test Error Rate
      Compute the performance metrics for your model using the predictions and real values of the target variable from your test data.

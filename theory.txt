Supervised vs Unsupervised

Supervised:
 1. Requires training data with independent variables & a dependent variables (labelled data)
 2. Need labelled data to "supervise" the algorithm when learning from the data
 examples
  -Regression Models
  -Classification Models

Unsupervised:
 1. Requires training data with independent variables only
 2. Not Need labelled data that can "supervise" the algorithm when learning from data
 examples
  -Clustering Models
  -Outlier Detection Models

Regression vs Classification

Regression:
 1. Can be used when the response variable to be predicted is a continuous variable (scaler)
 examples:
  -Linear Regression, Fixed Effects Regression, XGBoost Regression

Classification:
 1. Can be used when the response variable to be predicted is a continuous variable (scaler)
 examples:
  -Logistic Regression, XGBoost Classification

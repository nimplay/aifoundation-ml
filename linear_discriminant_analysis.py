""" Problem:
Sarah's Challenge: Loves trying new fruits, but wants to increase her odds of finding winners.

LDA to the Rescue: This technique helps predict "like" or "dislike" based on both size and sweetness.

How LDA Works: It analyzes Sarah's past choices, lookimg for the best way to separete the fruits she's enjoyed from the ones she hasn't.

Imagime drawing a line on the grahp to divide the "like" and "dislike" fruits as cleanly as possible.

The power of Combination: LDA shines when multiple features matters. It helps Sarah use size and sweetness together for potencially better predictions.
